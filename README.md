### Supported Image Models

Models are fetched dynamically from xororz's HuggingFace repos. The in-app model browser lets you search and filter by backend (CPU/NPU).

**CPU models (MNN backend — works on any ARM64 device):** ~5 models including Anything V5, Absolute Reality, QteaMix, ChilloutMix, and CuteYukiMix.

**NPU models (QNN backend — Snapdragon 8 Gen 1+):** ~20 models including all CPU models plus DreamShaper, Realistic Vision, MajicmixRealistic, MistoonAnime, NaiAnime, and many more. NPU models come in three chipset variants:
- `min` — non-flagship Snapdragon chips
- `8gen1` — Snapdragon 8 Gen 1
- `8gen2` — Snapdragon 8 Gen 2/3/4/5

| Backend | Model Size | Steps | Generation Time* |
|---------|-----------|-------|------------------|
| **CPU (MNN)** | ~1.2 GB | 20 | ~15 seconds |
| **NPU (QNN)** | ~1.0 GB | 20 | ~5-10 seconds |

*512×512 resolution, measured on Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. CPU times vary by device; NPU times depend on chipset variant.

  <img src="screenshots/fullscreen-image-viewer.jpg" width="300" alt="Fullscreen Image Viewer">
</p>

### Image Generation Features

- **Dynamic Model Browser**: Browse all available models from xororz's HuggingFace repos. Search by name, filter by CPU/NPU backend, see real file sizes, and download with one tap.
- **Background Generation**: Image generation continues even when you navigate between screens. Start generating, switch to another chat or the home screen, and come back — your image will have progressed or completed while you were away.
- **Image Gallery**: A dedicated gallery screen shows all your generated images in a grid. Open it from the Home screen or from the image icon in any chat header. When opened from a chat, it filters to show only images from that conversation.
- **Real-time Preview**: See your image emerge during generation (every 2 steps)
- **Automatic Intent Detection**: AI classifies if your message wants an image or text response
- **Manual Override**: Force image generation with the toggle button
- **Fullscreen Viewer**: Tap any generated image to view in fullscreen with details — prompt, steps, resolution, seed, and creation date. Save or delete from the viewer.
- **Save to Gallery**: Save generated images to your Pictures folder
- **Generation Timing**: See how long each image took to generate
- **Customizable Settings**:
  - Steps (4-50)
  - Guidance Scale (1-20)
  - Random or fixed seed

### Using Image Generation

1. **Download an Image Model**
   - Go to Models tab → Image Models section
   - Browse available models, search by name, or filter by CPU/NPU
   - Download any model (CPU models work on all devices, NPU models require Snapdragon 8 Gen 1+)

2. **Set as Active**
   - Tap "Set Active" on your downloaded model
   - The model loads automatically (or on next chat)

3. **Generate Images**
   - Type a descriptive prompt: "A majestic mountain at sunset with golden light"
   - **Auto Mode**: AI detects image requests automatically
   - **Force Mode**: Tap the image icon to force image generation
   - Wait for the magic ✨

4. **Save Your Creation**
   - Tap the generated image to view fullscreen
   - Tap "Save" to save to Pictures/LocalLLM

### Background Image Generation

Unlike most on-device AI apps, LocalLLM doesn't force you to stare at a progress bar. Image generation runs in a **lifecycle-independent background service** — the native inference continues on background threads while the JavaScript service layer maintains state independently of any screen.

**How it works:**

```
Start generation in Chat
        │
        ▼
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  ImageGenerationService     │  ← Singleton, not tied to any screen
│  (TypeScript service layer) │
│                             │
│  Owns all callbacks         │
│  Tracks progress, preview,  │
│  result, errors             │
│  Notifies subscribers       │
└──────────┬──────────────────┘
           │
           ▼
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  LocalDreamModule           │  ← Native MNN/QNN inference
│  (runs on background thread)│
│                             │
│  Continues even when JS     │
│  screens unmount             │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**What this means for you:**

1. Start image generation in any chat
2. Navigate freely — check settings, browse models, start a text chat
3. Come back to the chat and see real-time progress resumed instantly
4. If the image finished while you were away, it's already saved to the chat and the gallery

The gallery and any active screen subscribe to the service on mount and immediately receive the current state. No progress is lost.

### Image Gallery

All generated images are persisted and accessible from a dedicated Gallery screen:

- **From Home**: Tap the "Image Gallery" card to see all generated images
- **From Chat**: Tap the image icon in the chat header to see images from that conversation
- **Grid View**: All images displayed in a 3-column grid, newest first
- **Fullscreen Viewer**: Tap any image to view fullscreen with:
  - **Info panel**: Prompt, negative prompt, steps, resolution, seed, and date
  - **Save**: Export to Pictures/LocalLLM on device storage
  - **Delete**: Remove the image permanently
- **Active Generation**: If an image is being generated, a progress banner appears at the top of the gallery with preview thumbnail, progress bar, and cancel button
- **Long-press to delete**: Quick delete any image from the grid view
- **Cascade Delete**: When you delete a chat, all images generated in that conversation are automatically deleted as well — no orphaned files left behind

Image metadata is persisted across app restarts via AsyncStorage, so your gallery survives app closures.

### Image Generation Settings

| Setting | Range | Default | Description |
|---------|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Steps** | 4-50 | 20 | More steps = higher quality, slower |
| **Guidance Scale** | 1-20 | 7.5 | Higher = closer to prompt, less creative |
| **Seed** | Any | Random | Same seed = reproducible results |

**Pro Tips:**
- 20 steps at 512×512 generates in ~15 seconds on flagship devices
- Lower guidance for abstract art, higher for specific subjects
- Use detailed prompts: include style, lighting, composition

### Technical Details

**Download features:**
- **Combined progress for vision models** — Shows total progress including mmproj file
- **Background downloads on Android** — Downloads continue even when app is backgrounded
- **Automatic retry** — Handles network interruptions gracefully
- **Storage-aware** — Checks available space before downloading

### Memory Management

LocalLLM intelligently manages device memory to prevent crashes and ensure smooth performance.

**Memory safety features:**
- **Pre-load memory check** — Before loading any model, the app estimates RAM requirements and warns if memory is low
- **Dynamic memory budget** — Uses up to 60% of device RAM for models, adjusts based on your device
- **Combined RAM estimates** — Vision models show total RAM including mmproj overhead
- **Graceful warnings** — Yellow warning for tight memory, red block for insufficient memory
- **Memory display** — Home screen shows estimated RAM usage for loaded models

**RAM estimation:**
- Text models: File size × 1.5 (accounts for KV cache and activations)
- Image models: File size × 1.8 (accounts for ONNX runtime overhead)
- Vision projectors: Added to text model estimate

### Storage Management

Keep your device clean with built-in storage management tools.

**Settings → Storage** provides:
- **Storage overview** — Used vs. available space with visual bar
- **Model breakdown** — Size of each downloaded model (including mmproj)
- **Orphaned file detection** — Finds GGUF files on disk that aren't tracked as models (from failed downloads, manual copies, etc.)
- **Stale download cleanup** — Clears invalid download entries that can appear after interrupted downloads
- **Bulk deletion** — Delete all orphaned files with one tap

### On-Device Voice Transcription

Speak instead of type with Whisper-powered voice input. Like the LLM itself, transcription runs **entirely on-device**—your voice never leaves your phone.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Install Pre-built APK

1. Download the APK: **[Latest release (APK)](https://github.com/alichherawalla/offline-mobile-llm-manager/releases/latest)** (~166 MB)
2. Transfer to your Android device
3. Enable "Install from Unknown Sources" in Settings
4. Install and launch LocalLLM
5. Download a model and start chatting!

### Option 2: Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/alichherawalla/offline-mobile-llm-manager.git
cd LocalLLM

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run on connected Android device
npm run android
```

---

## How It Works

LocalLLM uses [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) compiled for Android to run GGUF-quantized language models directly on your device's CPU and GPU. The app intelligently detects your device's capabilities and recommends appropriate models.

### GPU Acceleration

LocalLLM supports GPU offloading for text model inference via the OpenCL backend on Qualcomm Adreno GPUs. Configure the number of GPU layers in Settings > Model Settings — each layer offloaded to the GPU reduces CPU load. If GPU initialization fails, the app automatically falls back to CPU-only inference.

The active backend (OpenCL or CPU) is displayed alongside every generated response, together with decode speed and time-to-first-token.

> **Note:** GPU support via OpenCL is experimental. On some Qualcomm devices the OpenCL compute driver can be unstable for LLM workloads. If you experience crashes, reduce GPU layers or disable GPU entirely — the CPU inference path with ARM NEON/i8mm/dotprod SIMD optimizations delivers strong performance on modern Snapdragon chips.

## Privacy & Security

**Your data stays on your device. Period.**

- All model inference runs locally using llama.cpp
- All voice transcription runs locally using whisper.cpp
- Conversations are stored only in local app storage
- No analytics, tracking, or telemetry
- No network requests except for model downloads
- Optional passphrase lock for sensitive conversations

### Network Activity

The **only** network activity is:
1. Fetching text model metadata from Hugging Face
2. Fetching image model listings from xororz's HuggingFace repos
3. Downloading model files (GGUF for text, ZIP for image)

After downloading models, the app works **completely offline**. Enable airplane mode and chat indefinitely.

LocalLLM supports any GGUF-format model compatible with llama.cpp:

### Text Models
- **Qwen3** - Excellent multilingual reasoning
- **Llama 3.2** - Meta's latest open models
- **Phi-3** - Microsoft's efficient small models
- **Gemma 2** - Google's open models
- **Mistral** - High-quality European models
- **SmolLM** - Hugging Face's tiny but capable models

### Vision Models
- **SmolVLM** - Compact vision-language model (recommended)
- **LLaVA** - Large Language and Vision Assistant
- **Qwen2-VL** - Qwen's vision-language models
- **MiniCPM-V** - Efficient multimodal models

Vision models automatically download the required mmproj companion file for image understanding.

And thousands more on Hugging Face...

## Technical Stack

- **React Native** with TypeScript
- **llama.rn** - Native GGUF model inference via llama.cpp with optional OpenCL GPU offloading
- **whisper.rn** - On-device speech recognition via whisper.cpp
- **local-dream** - Stable Diffusion image generation via MNN (CPU) and QNN (NPU) backends with auto backend selection
- **Android DownloadManager** - Native background model downloads that survive app backgrounding
- **Zustand** - State management with AsyncStorage persistence
- **React Navigation** - Native navigation with nested stacks

### Key Architecture Patterns

- **Singleton Services** — `activeModelService` manages model lifecycle to prevent duplicate loads and memory leaks
- **Memory-First Loading** — All model loads check available RAM before proceeding
- **Combined Asset Tracking** — Vision models track both main GGUF and mmproj as a single unit
- **Background-Safe Operations** — Downloads and image generation continue when screens unmount
- **Orphan Detection** — Storage management finds and cleans up untracked files
